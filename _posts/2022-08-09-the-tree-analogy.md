## Background
This will deviate *heavily* from the rest of my posts thus far, and is honestly pretty vulnerable. I've had some pretty drastic and destabilizing changes in my personal life over the last year or so. Naturally, this has led me to reflect pretty deeply about myself and my relationships. This analogy is something that I came up with that has helped me understand how to value people differently and pay more attention to their core.

## Explanation
I think one of the issues I've had with relationships is that I haven't been in love with, and had complete respect and value for, the core of the person I am dating. I couldn't fully value them. I think in order to truly have a healthy, happy, fulfilling relationship, that value and respect for their core needs to be there.

I think of it like a deciduous tree: the leaves (and fruit, but for this analogy we're just gonna focus on the leaves) whither away, die, and regrow every year. The trunk (and the main branches and the roots, but for this analogy we're just going to call this the "trunk"), however, the core, is always there. It also grows and develops, but if you chop a tree at the trunk, it essentially dies. Or, at least, it's no longer really the same tree. You've taken away its core.

I think it's the same way with people. Their "trunk" consists of their core values, their deep-down desires, and their unconscious biases and tendencies. It's what makes a person themselves. I think "trunk" items are mostly intangible concepts and qualities, and things that a person has complete control of at all times. And, importantly, I don't think they really change that much naturally. They take great effort and force to change. These are things like kind-heartedness, self-trueness, self-worth, conscientiousness, honesty, genuineness, transparency, empathy, intelligence, patience, bravery, humility, honor, self-sufficiency, gratitude, generosity; cruelty, self-suppression, insecurity, apathy, dishonesty, superficiality, manipulation, self-centeredness, stupidity, intolerance, cowardice, arrogance, immorality, helplessness, entitlement, greed.

The "leaves" are external things that happen to be the case right now, but can very easily change. These are things like hobbies, opinions, beliefs, financial status, education, relationships, physical health, mental health, fertility. I think I was taught, or somehow learned, to place too much value in the leaves. Here are some actual thoughts that I've had about women and relationships at one point or another in my life:

- "That would be so cool to date a snowboarder. We would have so much fun together!"
- "There's no way I could love a girl that likes country music."
- "I'm really worried about her spending."
- "I don't really want to have to wait for her to finish college."
- "There's probably a reason why she doesn't have very many friends."
- "She's too fat." (Look in the mirror, homeslice.)
- "She's too skinny."
- "She's too depressed."
- "I bet those hips will come in handy when we want to have kids!"

"But Jeff," you say. "Some of those things are dumb, but some of them are good things that you should look out for!" You're right! Leaves are important! But they can change. In fact, they can literally change in a second. I can say with confidence that my leaves have changed entirely in the last year and a half or so. They've definitely changed color. I don't even think they're the same shape! Despite all this, and very importantly, my trunk is very much still the same. For example, I stayed in the church for 25 years for the exact same reason that I left the church: conscientiousness and bravery.

I believe this focus on "leaves" has been a huge detriment to my relationships. I remember, in the beginning of my relationship with my now ex-wife, loving her a lot because of her "testimony". We did church things together, and it was great. Then, less than a year in, she she came to me with doubts about God and the church. I reacted in a way what was consistent with losing one of the core things I loved her for (spoiler alert: I was a complete jerk).

That's why you have to be careful with leaves. I think leaves are useful as a means of connecting with someone and discovering their trunk. But they cannot be the end-all. "But Jeff," you say. "Don't good leaves come from good trunks?" You're right! Sometimes. I think that some leaves are pretty easily recognizable as "good" or "bad", and the good ones lead pretty directly and obviously to good trunks. But I also think there are others that may appear to be good, but actually lead to a bad trunk, and vice versa. Example: consider a person who spends a lot of money. Well, they're obviously not self-sufficient or maybe they're just stupid. Okay, sure. But, what if they're just really generous and could also be really intelligent, but just haven't really learned how to make a budget yet? Another example: consider the opposite, a person who hardly spends any money. Well, they're obviously very self-sufficient and patient. Okay, sure. But, what if they're just really greedy? 

Taking the analogy further, I think there's a lot to be said for the "soil" of the tree as well. This one is kind of a less direct analogy, but by "soil" I'm talking about the environment the tree survives in, its challenges while growing, the nutrients it either does or does not have access to. There are a lot of different kinds of trees, and they all thrive in different environments. There are some that thrive in the rainforest, with fertile soil and lots of rain. There are some that thrive in more arid environments, with more direct sunlight and less moisture. I remember killing a plant that I had to take care of as part of a class because I watered it too much. Apparently there are over 60,000 identified tree species. Each type of tree is different, and each type of tree needs different "soil" to thrive.

Applying "soil" to people, our "soil" consists of our experiences growing up, our environment, the nature of our families, the values taught to us by our parents and teachers, etc. There are 7.753 billion people in this world, and I believe each person is completely unique, so there are at least 7.753 different "species" of people as well. In other words, an almost identical experience can have a completely different effect on the development of two people. Let's imagine that we have two people that both have parents that got divorced when they were children. It's not far-out to imagine that this experience led one to develop emotional maturity and a value for truly healthy relationships. However, in the other, it led to adult helplessness and, without an example of a healthy marriage in their life, relationships fraught with dishonesty and codependency. Let's imagine two other people that both experienced the death of a parent or loved one. In one case, this led to the person gaining a healthy acceptance of the inevitability of death and a cherishing of each day, while in the other, this led to the person having a debilitating fear of death that left them unable to actually live their life. Thus, in the same way that a similar leaf can be traced back to completely different "trunk" items, similar "soil" doesn't necessarily produce similar trunks. More on this in a bit.

But first, a quick tangent. I went through both of the above hypothetical experiences at ages 8 and 17, respectively. In my case, my parents' divorce led to some positive things: I think I was forced to focus only on the things that truly matter in life from an early age. I think it also made me be able to see the obvious flaws in my parents and learn from them, while also appreciating the good in them, and understanding that a person does not have to be perfect in order to be valuable or wonderful. On the negative side, it gave me an intense fear of failure that I am still working through today. My father's suicide led me to take mental health very seriously, and to be less judgmental and more understanding and loving towards other people. However, it also gave me a fear of abandonment, a fear of everything seeming fine one moment and then have it completely destroyed the next. I don't regret my "soil", because it made me who I am today, and I'm proud of who I am today. We cannot control our soil, but we do have control of the way we respond to it, let it impact us, and define who we are.

Herein lies another great stumbling block in my relationships. Going back to what I mentioned before, I have failed to understand that similar soil does not necessarily lead to similar trunks. The way my experiences have shaped me, for better and for worse, is not going to be true for everyone. When I was dating after my mission, I went on a few dates with a really nice girl. There was just one problem: she had too good of a childhood. I could infer that her family had always been pretty well-to-do, financially speaking. Her parents were still together, and she had deep connections with them and her siblings. I remember thinking, "well, good for her, but that means she probably isn't very empathetic and she won't understand my challenges. I think I would be better off with someone that's been through hard things." So I stopped seeing her. I look back on that and think, who was I to assume that about her without actually getting to know her? Also, who was I to assume that she hadn't been through "hard things"? Everyone goes through hard things, even if they seem less hard to me. Furthermore, it could have been that, in fact, she was taught empathy by her soil and would have been very understanding and supportive of my past and present hardships. Who knows?

Later, when I met my ex-wife, it seems like all it took was her to say, "oh, my parents are divorced, too" for me to be convinced that we were soul-mates.

For whatever reason, it seems like I heard a bunch of things from people who were "wiser" than me that perhaps sent me down this path that buried me in the soil. "Don't waste time with a girl that has daddy issues." "Surround yourself with people that have been through similar things as you." Or maybe I just invented that in my head. Either way, it has taken me years, and a lot of hardship, to realize that each person is completely unique, and that their experiences do not necessarily make them predisposed to be a great person, friend, or significant other.

Another quick tangent: this realization about "soil" has led to a large change in my attitude towards the choices and opinions of others. Particularly, this has calmed the animosity toward people in the church that I felt as I was leaving. My experience in the church is not identical to everyone's experience in the church. For many years, I knew about the issues in the church, and experienced first-hand the negative effects of church culture. But, I didn't leave the church. Instead, it led me to make sure that I was as welcoming and accepting of all kinds of people. It made me want to be as Christ-like as possible. It wasn't until later, for other reasons, that I ultimately decided to leave. Just because someone is still in the church, despite all the issues, doesn't mean that they aren't Christ-like or that they are apathetic, or that they are actively contributing to toxic church culture. Just because someone has left the church, doesn't mean they did it because of their conscientiousness or bravery. My experience is not everyone's experience, and my response to an experience is not the same as everyone's response to a similar experience. This goes both ways, and applies to everything.

"Alright, Jeff. Get back to it. I'm really confused. If you can't really trust leaves or soil, how can you ever discover the trunk?" You know, I'm not really sure. I'm kind of trying to figure that out right now. Here's my best hypothesis: concerning leaves, I think that someone that has a desirable trunk will produce mostly desirable leaves. I think the general trend, the correlation, will be there. There will be leaves that are outliers, that don't really make sense, but even if they're outliers, they're still a result of the trunk. With soil, I think it can give two people some shared experiences to connect with, but that can't be the end-all either. It seems my problem up to this point is selecting a few very specific leaves and similar soil very early on, and then holding on for dear life, ignoring contradictions about those early assumptions as I actually got to know their trunk in the months and years that followed. 

I don't remember exactly where I heard this, maybe it was on my sister in law's Instagram story at some point. But, it goes like this: a man is at his grandma's funeral. He asks his grandpa how, after more than sixty years of marriage, they still managed to be so in love and so happy. The grandpa says something to the effect of, "the key is that I love with your grandma for everything that she is at her core. Over the course of our marriage, I was probably married to at least a dozen pretty distinct versions of her. One version of her was a little more candid with me than others, another version of her wanted a little more independence than the others, and another was a little less god-fearing than the others. But that didn't change who she was at her core, and so I was able to keep supporting her over these transitions and had complete love for each new woman that she became."

Here in central Utah, I love the trees. The chokecherries, cottonwoods, douglas hawthornes, serviceberries, and maples are more beautiful than the trees anywhere else I've lived. In the summer, they are green and full and lush. In the autumn, their leaves change into the most beautiful hues of yellow, orange, and red. In the winter, they appear pretty dead, but after a fresh snow, they appear bright-white and so majestic. In the spring, they grow the most heavenly white and pink blossoms that are absolutely breathtaking, even if some have a bit of a foul odor. Though their leaves change each season, it is their strong trunks and roots that produce such beauty all year-round.

It's the trunk and the roots that weather the storms and survive the changing of the seasons.

"Now Jeff," you say. "You sure have spent a lot of time evaluating and critiquing everybody else. What about your trunk?" Great point! As I stated before, I am proud of who I am. I am proud of my trunk as a whole. I probably value my trunk more now than I ever have in my life. At the risk of coming across as a total narcissist, I am kind-hearted, veracious, confident, conscientiousness, honest, genuine, empathetic, intelligent, humble, honorable, self-sufficient, and generous. However, there are definitely still some pain points in my trunk. I think I lack transparency in relationships; I am hesitant to bring up hard things with my significant other. I think I can be a bit of a coward if I think that doing the right thing is going to hurt someone's feelings, so I hold back until eventually I can't handle it anymore. I also tend to be less grateful and more entitled. Again, I value myself for who I am, but these are things I want to work through. They are trunk items, so they are going to take a lot of work to change. Some of them might not even really be changeable, but at least I will be aware of them.

"Now Jeff," you say. "You seem to be expecting that you'll find this perfect trunk with no defects and such, but you just admitted that your trunk has flaws. How can you expect perfection in someone else when you aren't perfect yourself?" Great point! I will clarify that I am not expecting perfection. Every trunk has its gashes, scrapes, and holes. I can still be completely in love with a person that still has a few not-so-desirable trunk items or leaves. It's also incorrect to think that a person is either 100% kind-hearted or 100% cruel, 100% brave or 100% a coward. These things exist in a spectrum, and that's an important caveat in my overly-simple analogy. I am simply hoping that I can make wiser choices with future relationships, and this analogy has unlocked this understanding for me. And, as I stated before, I know how to appreciate the good in a person and understand that they don't have to be perfect in order to be completely valued, respected, and loved by me.

I think what I've learned, then, through writing this, is it takes a long time to really get to know someone's trunk. Many months, ideally many years. There is no rush. Get to know the person first. Develop a real friendship based on mutual respect and value. Enjoy bonding over our shared soil and leaves, but give the trunk the real weight. Don't jump straight into "boyfriend/girlfriend" status. Then, if or when that does happen, don't jump straight into "we're going to move in together and then have a life together and then have kids and then grow old together and then spoil our grandkids and then..." Give ourselves time to keep discovering each other's trunks.

And that's exactly where the fun and fulfillment exists: in the journey. Luckily for us all, there are a lot of really awesome trees out there.
