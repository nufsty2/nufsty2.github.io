Hey there! I'm Jeff

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/assets/images/MeAndWifey.jpg" /></div>

I'm a senior at Brigham Young University majoring in **Computer Engineering** and minoring in **Computer Science**. My wife, Kristine, and I met here at BYU in our BIO 100 class, and we just celebrated our two year anniversary!

## Interests

### Computers
I have been intrigued by computers for most of my life! Deciding to make a career out of my interest was really solidified when I assembled a PC during my sophomore year in high school to play Battlefield 3 with my friends. As I ordered the parts and put everything together, I noticed I got more of a thrill out of building the computer and seeing what it could do than actually playing video games on it. As I examined the parts, I was astounded at how what seemed like a bunch of pieces of fiber glass could perform something magical. Admittedly, I still don't understand the full picture of how a computer works, but through my education I have been able to learn small pieces like digital circuit design, instruction set architecture, serial communication, and transistor physics! 

### Programming
I took my first programming class in high school, learning just a little bit of Java. I thought solving problems through programming was so interesting and exciting. I found that I liked to think like a computer, and developing algorithms to accomplish simple tasks came naturally to me! I have been coding regularly for about the past three years now, and have added C, C++, Verilog, MATLAB, and a little bit of C#, JS, HTML, and Markdown to my skill set.

### Recreation
I love getting outdoors as much as I have time to. I love anything that ends in "-boarding". Living in the Silicon Slopes area is wonderful for that. I have been a huge football fan for my whole life, and my favorite teams are the BYU Cougars for college (I was at [this](https://youtu.be/8TT78kCie_I) game as a wee 10 year old!) and the Chicago Bears for pros.

### Family
My poor mother gave birth to three wild boys, with me being the last. Both of my older brothers are software developers, so we have a lot of fun together!
Most of all, I love spending time with my wife. Any time I can get free from homework and other responsibilities, my wife and I enjoy cooking together, taking drives, and spending countless hours watching our favorite shows on Netflix.

### What's up with your nickname? What is "Nufsty" supposed to mean?
"Nufsty" is something that my dad used to call me as a little kid, and I like it so I've stuck with it. I have no idea what it means or where he came up with it.
